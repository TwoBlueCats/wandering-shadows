You can move around the floor using arrows or numpad (with "`yubn`" keys for diagonal moves) and also skip turns (period

There is floor minimap in right bottom corner, it shows explored and visible part of floor in same manner as main map.
To mark some rooms or tunnels you can put where torches using "`t`" key and collect them back, you have unlimited number

To pick item from floor use "`g`" key (or use "`f`" to use item from floor). To use item from inventory you need to open
inventory list ("`i`" key, or "`p`", "`m`", "`q`" as shortcuts for potions, magic items and equipment) and when
press "`a-z`" to choose item. You can also inspect items characteristics by pressing "`e`" and choosing item.

Inventory has limited size (you can see it in character info screen) so you need to drop items by pressing "`d`" and
choosing item.
